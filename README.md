#Planet-TUI
An educational terminal user interface about the solar system.

This program includes:
-Information pages for all 8 of the major planets in the Solar System based on data from JPL at the set time
-A visualization of the Solar System with ASCII graphics. (also based on JPL data at the set time)
-An animation mode for the Solar System visualization
-Settable Date and Time
-Settable Units

This program notable uses:
-A custom sort of mini library to display text information to the screen. This library is something I programmed especially for this project, and it includes customizable
textboxes, rings, and circles that can orbit. I used this to build a sort of terminal user interface.
-JPL DATA for both the information pages and Solar System visualization


Some interesting things you can do with this program include:
-Setting the date to a solstice or equinox and seeing how Earth will be lined up at a 90-degree angle from the Vernal Equinox
-Setting the date to your birthday and then setting the date to the current day and looking to see how the planet’s positions have changed since you were born
-Animating the solar system and watching how planets further from the Sun move at slower rates
-Checking the distances of one planet to another in light minutes and imagining that this is how long it would take for a one to send a radio signal from one planet to another.

Compatability:
Currently this program is only compatable with Windows devices. This is because the program uses windows escape codes for animation.
